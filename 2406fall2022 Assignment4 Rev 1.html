<h2>Express.js Music Server</h2>
<p>The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice building a node.js application that accesses a public API, and uses the express.js framework. For this assignment you are given a choice to make either a thin client or a thick client solution.</p>
<p>This assignment is based on Tutorial 07 and the course notes 14 on   creating express.js applications.</p>
<p>The components are:</p>
<p >Server build with just Node.js and the Express.js framework. </p>
<p >Public iTunes JSON API.</p>
<p >Client side application page served by the server.</p>
<p >Either a thin client or thick client solution:<br>
  <br>
  <span class="bold">Thin Client</span> -the server creates the HTML web pages based on client requests. The client simply renders the html pages.</p>
<p ><span class="bold">Thick Client</span> -
  client side javascript that manipulates the DOM (HTML elements) directly based on the JSON data the client receives from the server. (Client-Server data exchange should be based on JSON.)</p>
<p >Assignment restrictions: <br>
</p>
<p class="red">You are (finally) free to use express.js and whatever other npm modules you find useful though no other ones are really necessary for the assignment.</p>
<hr width="100%">
<p><span class="badge-danger">Marking:</span> This assignment

<h2>Submission and Good Programming Practice Requirements</h2>
<p>The following requirements pertain to all 
  your assignments regardless of what your application is supposed to do (i.e. 
  regardless of the design requirements). These requirements are to ensure that 
  your code is usable, readable, and maintainable.</p>
<p class="text-danger"><span class="badge badge-danger"><span class="requirement_danger">R0.0</span></span> <span class="red">UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT. The solution 
  and code you submit MUST be unique. That is, it cannot be a copy of, or be too 
  similar to, someone else's code, or other code found elsewhere. You are, however, free to use any code posted on our course website as 
  part of our assignment solution. <span class="font-weight-bold">[Assignment mark =0 if this requirement is not met.]</span></span></p>
<p class="text-danger"><span class="badge badge-danger"><span class="requirement_danger">R0.1</span></span> <span class="red">CODE SUBMISSION ORGANIZATION AND COMPILATION: You should submit all the code files and data files necessary to compile and run your app. The TA's will execute your app by following the instructions you provide in the <span class="code">README.txt</span> file. You must submit a single<span class="code">.zip</span> formatted file to brightspace. (not .rar or .tar or whatever). Though you are permitted to write code on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS the code must be generic enough to be OS agnostic. (See also the the requirement below about not submitting the <span class="code">node_modules</span> directory). Your code must work with at least a current Chrome browser and version 16.x.x of node.js<br>
  <span class="font-weight-bold">[Assignment mark =0 if this requirement is not met.]</span></span></p>
<p class="text-danger"><span class="badge badge-danger"><span class="requirement_danger">R0.2</span></span> <span class="red">README FILE: Your submission MUST include a <span class="code">README.txt</span> file telling the TA how to setup and run your app. <span class="font-weight-bold">The TA should NOT have to look into your code to figure out how to start up your app.</span> Your <span class="code">README.txt</span> MUST contain the following:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="text-danger"><span class="red"><span class="font-weight-bold">Your name, student number.</span></span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="text-danger"><span class="red"><span class="font-weight-bold">Version:</span> node.js version number and OS you  tested on your code on.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="text-danger"><span class="red"><span class="font-weight-bold">Install:</span> how to install needed code modules. This will likely look like <code>npm install</code> or <code>npm install module_name</code></span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="text-danger"><span class="red"><span class="font-weight-bold">Launch:</span> Instructions on how to launch your app. e.g. <code>node server.js</code>. As the course progresses there will be more launch options so it's important to provide instructions.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="text-danger"> <span class="red"><span class="font-weight-bold">Testing:</span> Provide Instructions on what the TA should do to run your app. e.g. visit </span><span class="code">http://localhost:3000/mytest.html?name=Louis</span><span class="red">. If your app requires a userid/password to run then provide one for the TA to use. Your server should print to the console the URL's that should be visited by the browser to demonstrate your app. List them in the order you want us to visit them:</span></p>
    <p class="text-danger"><img src="images/R0.2.png" width="558" height="142" alt=""/></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="text-danger"><span class="red"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues:</span> List any issues that you want the marker to be aware of. In particular, tell us what requirements you did not implement or that you know are not working correctly in the submitted code. Here you are giving us your own assessment of your app.</span></p>
  </li>
  <p class="text-danger"><span class="red">Pay attention to any specific URL's that must be supported by your app. </span></p>
  <p class="text-danger"><span class="red"><span class="font-weight-bold">[Assignment mark =0 if this requirement is not met.]</span></span></p>
  <p class="text-danger">&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<p class="text-danger"><span class="badge badge-danger"><span class="requirement_danger">R0.3</span></span> <span class="red">INTENT REQUIREMENT: The solution 
  and code you submit must comply with the intent of the assignment. For example if you are required to build a node.js/javascript server and you choose to build an apache/PHP server instead you will have violated the intent of the assignment even though the user input-output experience might be the same. As another example, if you are asked to build a &quot;thick client&quot; solution where the server just supplies data and the browser renders it but you build a &quot;thin client&quot; solution where the server renders all the HTML pages you will have violated the intent even though the user's experience would look the same. <br>
</span><span class="red"> <span class="font-weight-bold">[Assignment mark =0 if this requirement is not met.]</span></span></p>
<p class="text-danger">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-warning"><span class="requirement_warning">R0.4</span></span> <span class="bold">VARIABLE AND FUNCTION NAMES:</span> All of 
  your variables and functions should have meaningful names that reflect 
  their purpose. Don't follow the convention common in math courses where they 
  say things like: &quot;let x be the number of customers and let y be the number of 
  products...&quot;. Instead call your variables <strong>numberOfCustomers</strong> or <strong>numberOfProducts</strong>. Your program should not have any variables 
  called &quot;x&quot; unless there is a good reason for them to be called &quot;x&quot;. (One 
  exception: It's OK to call simple for-loop counters i,j and k etc. when the 
  context is clear and VERY localized.) Javascript variables don't have types which can help clarify their meaning so choosing good names is even more important. Many functions in javascript are annonymous (have no name) and so the name of the variable that refers to them is even more important.</p>
<p>Remember: any fool can write code that a computer will understand; the goal is to write code that we can understand. <span class="font-weight-bold"><span class="red">[Minus 2 marks from assignment if this requirement is not met.]</span></span></p>
<p><span class="badge badge-warning"><span class="requirement_warning">R0.5</span></span> <span class="bold">JAVASCRIPT IN STATIC HTML:</span> Your static html pages should NOT make direct reference to javascript functions. Don't do something like the following:</p>
<pre>&lt;button type="button" onclick="myFunction()"&gt;Try it&lt;/button&gt;</pre>
<p>Instead do something like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;button type="button" id="submit_button"&gt;Try it&lt;/button&gt;</pre>
<p>and elsewhere in your javascript file say:<br>
</p>
<pre>document.getElementById('submit_button').addEventListener('click', myFunction)
</pre>
<p><span class="red">[Minus 2 marks from assignment if this requirement is not met.]</span></p>
<p><span class="badge badge-warning"><span class="requirement_warning">R0.6</span></span> <span class="bold">COMMENTS:</span> Comments in your code 
  must coincide with what the code actually does. It is a  common bug to modify or cut-and-paste code and forget to modify the comments and so you 
  end up with comments that say one thing and code that actually does another. Don't over-comment your code - instead choose good variable names 
  and function names that make the code  &quot;self commenting&quot;. Don't be reluctant to create local variables  so that the variable name provides more clarity -there is no prize for having the fewest lines of code. <span class="font-weight-bold"><span class="red">[Minus 2 marks from assignment if this requirement is not met.]</span></span></p>
<p><span class="badge badge-warning"><span class="requirement_warning">R0.7</span></span> <span class="bold">MODULARIZATION:</span> Your client-side and server-side javascript should not be in two giant files. Break you client-side javascript into smaller manageable and readable  files and include them individually with <span class="code">&lt;script&gt;</span> tags in your html document. On the server-side use <span class="code">requires</span> or <span class="code">imports</span> appropriately to organize your code into managable size files. <span class="font-weight-bold"><span class="red">[Minus 2 marks from assignment if this requirement is not met.]</span></span></p>
<p><span class="badge badge-warning"><span class="requirement_warning">R0.8</span></span> <span class="bold">BLOATED CODE:</span> If your assigment uses external modules installed with npm, <span class="bold">DON'T</span> submit the <span class="code">node_modules</span> directory with your code (it's potentially huge).  Remove that directory and only submit the <span class="code">package.json</span> and <span class="code">package-lock.json</span> files. The TAs will use these files to intall the required modules. NPM modules are platform specific and must be reinstalled on the markers platform (they would have to remove your <span class="code">node_modules</span> directory). <span class="font-weight-bold"><span class="red">[Minus 2 marks from assignment if this requirement is not met.]</span></span></p>
<p><span class="badge badge-warning"><span class="requirement_warning">R0.9</span></span> <span class="bold">CITATION REQUIREMENT:</span> If you use code from other sources you should cite the source in comments that appear with the code. If the source is an internet website then put the URL in the comments. You may use bits of code from outside sources but this may not form the complete solution you are handing in.You DON'T have to cite demo code we provide on the course web site or with tutorials and assignments, however that code should not be used for things you post publicly (like on GitHub). <span class="font-weight-bold"><span class="red">[Minus 2 marks from assignment if this requirement is not met.]</span></span></p>
<p class="red">VERY IMPORTANT: Any 
  sample code fragments provided may have bugs (although none are put there intentionally). You must be prepared to find errors in the 
  requirements and sample code. Please report errors so they can be fixed and an assignment 
  revision posted.</p>

<h1>Application Requirements</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Public HTTP-based API's (often referred to as RESTful API's) have become very popular. They typically serve JSON data based on client HTTP requests. They also respect the stateless nature of HTTP -the client provides everything in each query that the server needs to respond. API's don't typically serve web-pages rather they serve XML or JSON data that other servers or &quot;thick&quot; clients can use to populate web pages. Or, in the internet of things, maybe no web pages are ever involved. API's are nice because their data can be consumed and repackaged in many different ways (browsers, mobile apps, IoT devices). </p>
<p>We want to build a client-server app that uses the iTunes API for providing the details of recorded songs based on querying by song title. This is based on the work you would have done in tutorial 07. </p>
<p>The client webpage should look something like the following (subject to the requirements provided).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/page_layout.png" alt="pics"></p>
<h2>Application Requirements</h2>
<h2>1) Server-Side Requirements</h2>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R1.1</span></span> The server should be built as an Express.js application. It could be a very simple or minimal express app or use many express features -no particular complexity is specified.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R1.2</span></span> The server application should make use of a <span class="code">package.json</span> file to specify all the npm modules needed by your app (possibly only express.js) The marker should be able to install all the module by executing <span class="code">npm install</span>. DO NOT submit installed npm modules with your assignment. We want to install those ourselves and keep the submitted code size small. In other words, don't submit your <span class="code">node_modules</span> directory with your code.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R1.3</span></span> Your <span class="code">package.json</span> file should list specific version numbers of the modules you install. Don't have it install &quot;the latest&quot; modules. You must be specific about the version number. You may, however, use the optimitic version numbering if you want (i.e. the version number with the ^ character in front of it.)</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R1.4</span></span> With Express.js and package.json comes new ways of launching your server app. Up until now we have always lauched with the command <span class="code">node server.js</span>. Make sure your <span class="code">README.txt</span> file tells us <span class="bold">exactly</span> how to launch your app;   the marker will not be expected to try and figure it out. Also include the instructions for installing the npm modules you need in your <span class="code">README.txt</span> file.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R1.5</span></span> The server should obtain song infromation from the <span class="bold">iTunes </span>public API. (This API does not require an APP ID.) Note if you want to substitute a different music API like SoundCloud or Spotify that is OK as long as it can meet the requirements of the assignment. The client should have no directly interaction with the API. That is, the client should not be aware of what API the server is using (the server should be able to switch to another API without affecting the client).</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R1.6</span></span> If your server needs to serve static files to the client then it should provide a static server using the <span class="code">express use(express.static ...) </span><span class="bold">middleware</span>. If your application does not require a static server part then you don't need to provide this and the requirement will be deemed as met.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R1.7</span></span> The amount of song data served by the server should be reasonable. (If the API queries provide too much data the server should reduce it to a reasonable amount before sending the response to the client).<span class="code"></span> Thus the client can be coded to render, or show, all the data provided by the server. You can limit the API search to, say,  20 songs by default.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>2) Client Layout Requirements</h2>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R2.1</span></span> The client webpage should have three areas: a Playlist area, an Input Area, and a Search Results area. The Playlist area should be at the top of the page, the Input Area below that and the Search Results area at the bottom. <span class="code"></span>The Playlist area should have a heading: &quot;Playlist&quot; and the Search results area should have a heading &quot;Songs matching: Body And Soul&quot; in which the heading shows the song title being matched.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R2.2</span></span> The playlist area should have a heading as described above and a table of songs representing the user's playlist. The table should have four columns. Column one should contain three buttons. The first button should be labelled &quot;-&quot;, the second with some kind of &quot;up arrow&quot; character and the third with some kind of &quot;down arrow&quot; character. These buttons are intended to be used to 1) remove a song from the playlist, 2) move a song up in the playlist order, and 3) move a song down in the playlist order. The second column should show the title of the song. The third column should show the artist. The fourth column should show an image of the song recordings artwork. It is up to you whether the table is shown with borders or not.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R2.3</span></span> The input area should consist of a label: &quot;Enter Song Title:&quot;, a textfield where the user can enter a song title and a <span class="bold">submit</span> button.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R2.4</span></span> The song search area should have a heading as described above and a table of songs representing the search results. The table should have four columns. Column one should contain a button labelled &quot;+&quot;. This button is intended to be used to add the song to the user's plalylist. The second column should show the title of the song. The third column should show the artist. The fourth column should show an image of the song artwork. It is up to you whether the table is shown with borders or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3) Client Behaviour Requirements</h2>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.1</span></span> The client should be able to reach the server at any of the following URL's <br>
<span class="code">http://localhost:3000/mytunes.html</span><br>
<span class="code">http://localhost:3000/mytunes</span><br>
<span class="code">http://localhost:3000/index.html</span><br>
<span class="code">http://localhost:3000/</span><br>
<span class="code">http://localhost:3000</span></p>
<p>That is, all those routes should amount to the same thing. Here you need to figure out the best way to handle multiple URL's that should resolve to the the same result. When the app launches the users playlist area should be empty. That is, there is no requirement in this assignment for the application to remember the user's playlist.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.2</span></span> When the client types a song title into the labelled text box and presses the &quot;submit&quot; button or hits the enter key the page should be refreshed, or a new page loaded, with new song data obtained from the server. Their current playlist should not be affected by this operation.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.3</span></span> The song search results should be displayed as an html table with the four columns described in the layout requirements. The artwork of the song should appear as an image in the table. </p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.4</span></span> If the &quot;+&quot; button of a song in pressed in a search results tabel row then that song should be added to the bottom of the user's playlist table. The page should update right away when the &quot;+&quot; button is pressed.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.5</span></span> If the &quot;-&quot; button of a song in the user's playlist table row is pressed that song should be removed from the the user's playlist table and the number of rows in the table should shrink. The page should update right away when the &quot;-&quot; button is pressed.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.6</span></span> The songs in the playlist area are in order. If a song's &quot;up arrow&quot; button is pressed that song should move up one position in the the user's playlist table. If the song is already at the top position the button press can be ignored. The page should update right away when the &quot;up arrow&quot; button is pressed.</p>
<p><span class="badge badge-success"><span class="requirement">R3.7</span></span> The songs in the playlist area are order. If the song's &quot;down arrow&quot; button is pressed that song should move down one position in the the user's playlist table. If the song is already at the bottom position the button press can be ignored. The page should update right away when the &quot;down arrow&quot; button is pressed.</p>
